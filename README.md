# BC-store
BC-store is available in two versions available for download in this repository: 
- desktop for Windows and other OS with Python3 and required libraries
- command line for operating systems with pre-installed Python3

# How it works from the command line
The program is launched by running it from the command line:
python3 [path to bc-store_script.py] [command] [options by whitespace]
There are 4 main commands:
check_set – checks the current set based on the proportions according to the selected criterion
add_to_set (not now available) – selects the desired number of barcodes and adds to the existing set, taking into account the proportions according to the selected criterion from the selected set of barcodes
help – help with the examples of commands and explanation of options and format for entering parameters
MGI_sets – displays successful sets of barcodes according to the MGI manual

# How it works on the desktop version
The desktop version has the numbering of input fields and buttons.
When you start the desktop version, an additional window opens where errors are displayed so that you do not need to close it for the program to work correctly. The main areas of work are set analysis, set selection and output of basic sets. After clicking the "Click to analyse set" button and, if there are additional set barcodes, when clicking the "Click to analyze adding" button, the user will be provided with a graph. Do not press buttons "Click to analyse set" and "Click to analyze adding" until you have filled in all the required fields. 
The program  presents the output information on user-defined barcodes, mixing proportions, values of nucleotide representation, and the main information on whether this set meets the strong and lite criteria
